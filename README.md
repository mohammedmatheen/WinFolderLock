# WinFolderLock
To lock your private folder on windows 10 

1 - Name the folder as private.

2 - Download this txt file.

3 - open it and change password - "YOUR PASSWORD" as whatever you want.

4 - Save this txt file as a .bat file in the location where you have the folder named private.

5 - run the .bat file which you have saved.

6 - It will open CMD type "Y".

7 - your folder is now hidden and encrypted, you will only see the .bat file.

8 - Run the .bat file again to access your folder, enter the password which you set in the .bat file earlier.

And you good to go, Cheers.
